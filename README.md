# Dota 2 Sentinel Bot
Dota 2 Sentinel bot is an automated bot that is built directly on top of Steam network to be able to **automatically host lobbies** and track the match results afterwards. It's main goal is to **automatically ban the leavers** and keep them returning to Sentinel hosted lobbies when there is an ongoing ban detected by simply kicking that player. Additional restriction is put in place to restrict new players from joining the lobby because once a player is banned creating a new user is very easy. Sentinel Bot is **able to host any custom game lobby** that has dedicated servers provided by Valve. Bans are global, meaning if you quit in one game you won't be able to join any game that is hosted by the same bot.
